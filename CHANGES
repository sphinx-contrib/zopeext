This file describes user-visible changes between the extension versions.

Version 0.4.3 (2024-01-17)
==========================
* Support Sphinx up to 7.2.6 (tested).
* Fixed some bugs with python 3.7 and 3.8.

Version 0.4.2 (2023-04-19)
==========================
* Actually add the namespace package!
* Working GitHub CI and ReadTheDocs.

Version 0.4.0 (2023-04-18)
==========================
* Drop support for Python 3.6
* Drop support for Sphinx 3 (minimum version is now 4.5.0)
* Resolves issue #9: No upper bounds on versions.  (Using PDM instead of Poetry.)

Version 0.3.3 (2022-09-04)
==========================
* Resolves issue #7, support for Sphinx 5.x. (Thanks to Jerry James @jamesjer).
* Better test coverage for different version combinations.

Version 0.3.2 (2022-01-05)
==========================
* Resolves issue #5 by removing sphinxcontrib/__init__.py which could be installed
  by different sphinxcontrb packages like sphinxcontrib-asyncio.

Version 0.3.1 (2022-01-05)
==========================
* Resolves issue #3 (bug when missing members were requested).
* Added more extensive testing following Sphinx's examples.

Version 0.3.0 (2021-12-22)
==========================
* Major restructuring of code to work with poetry rather than setuptools.
* Update and simplification of code to work with Sphinx >= 3.4.2.  Prior
  versions relied on some private behaviour which is deprecated.  The new
  version can now use the public API.
* Resolves issue #1 by inserting a small javascript snippet that changes
  ``class="py interface"`` to ``class="py interface class"`` so that themes
  which don't provide support for styling interface (most of them) will
  fallback to using the same format as a class.

Version 0.2.4 (2020-03-15)
==========================
* Fixed issue with :members: requesting ALL members.

Version 0.2.3 (2019-11-01)
==========================
* Fixed some Python 3 errors and Sphinx deprecation warnings.

Version 0.2.2 (2017-07-26)
==========================

* Removed stripping of `cls`, and `self` from signatures.  It is an error to
  include these arguments in an Interface as they are not part of the public
  interface of the object.  Interfaces with these will not validate properly.
* Do not include constructor in interface - add docstring (if it is provided)
  to the class documentation.

Version 0.2.1 (2013-05-01)
==========================

* Removed automatic import of `autointerface` to facilitate setup.  New code
  must now `import sphinxcontrib.zopeext.autointerface` explicitly.

Version 0.2 (2012-07-24)
========================

* Added website__.
* Added documentation.
* Added to PyPi.
* Added example.py
